      "special_treatment": "Enzyme stability is highly dependent on CaCl2; 0.2–0.8 mmol L−1 CaCl2 is added during purification and storage. For long-term storage, addition of 50% (v/v) glycerol increases stability. Lyophilized enzyme requires reactivation in buffer before use. No activating metal ion required for activity, but Ca2+ is essential for stability. Enzyme is unstable without Ca2+ (half-life ~6 h), but with Ca2+ (0.8 mmol L−1) half-life at 8°C is 163 h.  No posttranslational modifications reported. "

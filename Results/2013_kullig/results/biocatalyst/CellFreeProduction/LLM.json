      "special_treatment": "RADH was cloned into pET-22b(+) and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Purification involved size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and anion exchange chromatography. Buffers were supplemented with CaCl2 (0.2 or 0.8 mmol/L) for stabilization. Purification and storage were performed in TEA–HCl buffer (10 or 50 mmol/L, pH 7.5) with CaCl2. Enzyme was stored at -20°C in buffer or as lyophilized powder. For activity/stability studies, 0.8 mmol/L CaCl2 was added. SDS–PAGE confirmed ~90% purity. Native molecular weight determined by SEC (trimeric, ~75 kDa). Enzyme is unstable without CaCl2; addition of CaCl2 significantly increases stability. Lyophilized enzyme requires reactivation in buffer before use. No activating metal ion required for activity, but Ca2+ is essential for stability. All purification steps at room temperature (20–25°C)."

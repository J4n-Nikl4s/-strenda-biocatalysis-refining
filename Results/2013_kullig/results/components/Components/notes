for TEA–HCl buffer was the buffer stated 7.5 or 10.5 it was never tested at pH 10.5 most of the time at 7.5 and of the pH at a range between 7-8
in general only one pH was expracted but the same buffer system was used the different pH was not extracted
CAS number, smiels  was not in the publication but was filled out correctly 
MgCl2, CaCl2, KCl is not clearly stated which supplier was used LLM is writing from Sigma
created two different itemes for different concentations fo CaCl2 how do we should we handle thsi?
formulation is used more as a discription 
SMILES were not in the publication but filled out for most of them 
SMILES for NADPH/+ is not correct 
only Benzaldehyde from the aldehydes was extracted not the others
Has not extracted all componentes were extracted

Ideas:
purity is a float but in the paper it is stated that the are analytic grande

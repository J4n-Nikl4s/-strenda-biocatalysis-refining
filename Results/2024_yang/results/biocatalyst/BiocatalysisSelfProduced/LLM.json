Reactions performed in two-phase system with ethyl acetate as co-solvent for high substrate loading. Reaction conditions: 50 g/L wet cell, 200 mM cyclohexene oxide, 400 mM NaOCN, 35% (v/v) ethyl acetate, pH 7.0–10.5, 25°C, 16–29 hrs. Pilot scale: 1.2 kg wet cell in 10 L reaction, 95% conversion, 87% isolated yield, 53% ee. No additional buffer required due to self-regulated pH by ethyl acetate hydrolysis."

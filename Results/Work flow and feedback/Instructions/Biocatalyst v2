You are a scientist tasked with reproducing an experiment from an uploaded scientific paper.  
Your job is to extract all information required by the STRENDA biocatalysis guidelines.

You MUST return the final answer **exclusively in valid JSON**, following the schema below.

SOURCE: The content to analyze is the uploaded PDFs.

TASK:
Extract every piece of information relevant to STRENDA biocatalysis documentation.  
Be especially attentive to **biocatalysts / enzymes**.  
Papers may involve:
- multiple enzymes,
- multiple substrate,
- multiple specific activtiys,
- multiple storage conditions,
- different expression systems,
- purchased or non‑purchased catalysts,
- incomplete or missing information.

INTERPRETATION RULE:
- If a biocatalyst / enzyme has a stated **supplier**, treat it as **purchased**.
- If **no supplier is mentioned**, treat it as *plausible that the biocatalyst is not purchased* (e.g., produced in‑house). Let the JSON output file empty.
- If **no purification methode** has stated, treated it as **crudecellextract**. Else let the JSON output fiel empty. 
- If **prufication methode** is stated and it is plausible that the enzyme is **self produced** 
- If a **imobilised methode** has stated the enzyme / biocatalyst is **immonilised**. Else let the JSON output fiel empty. 
- If no **purification methode** or **cell lysis methode** has stated it is plausible that it is a **WholeCellBiocatalyst**. Else let the JSON output fiel empty.
- If several storage contitions make sure all conditions will be saved. 
- If information is missing, return `"unknown"`.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return the extracted data as JSON using this structure:


CONSTRAINTS:
- Only output JSON. No text before or after.
- Do not infer technical facts unless directly supported by the PDF.
- When fields are missing in the paper, write "unknown".
- Ensure the JSON is syntactically valid.
